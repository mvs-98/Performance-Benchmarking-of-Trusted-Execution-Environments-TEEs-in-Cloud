Steps to run Machine Learning microservice application

1. Create a python file with microservice application using below command,
"nano mlbenchmark.py"

2. Run the python file using below command (Requires python installed or python virtual environment),
"python mlbenchmark.py"

3. This will create the output files that contains benchmarking values.

4. Follow above steps to run microservice application in all four virtual machines. Need to change the output file names as per the machine names in which benchmarking is done.

5. Gather the output files on a single virtual machine using scp command.

6. In the same directory create the python script used to plot the graph using below command,
"nano mlplot.py"

7. Run the python script to plot the graph using below command (Requires python installed or python virtual environment),
"python mlplot.py"

8. This will save the graph in png format in same directory.

9. Get the graph from virtual machine into your local machine using scp command.
