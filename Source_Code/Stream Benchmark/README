Steps to run STREAM benchmark

1. Install STREAM benchmark and compile C source code on all four virtual machines using below command,
"wget https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/FTP/Code/stream.c"
"gcc -O stream.c -o stream"

2. Create and run the shell script using below commands,
"nano runstream.sh"
"chmod +x runstream.sh"
"./runstream.sh"

3. This will create and store benchmark output in a text file in the format "machinename.txt"

4. Run the benchmark on all four virtual machines, which will create 4 output files with name as per machine names.

5. Gather all the output files in one particular virtual machine using scp command

6. In the same directory create the python script used to plot the graph using below command,
"nano streambench.py"

7. Run the python script to plot the graph using below command (Requires python installed or python virtual environment),
"python streambench.py"

8. This will save the graph in png format in same directory.

9. Get the graph from virtual machine into your local machine using scp command.
